#Task 4

"""
Task 4. Create and expose a deployment in Kubernetes
Kurt created the deployment.yaml and service.yaml to deploy your new container image to a Kubernetes cluster (called valkyrie-dev). The two files are in valkyrie-app/k8s.

Get the Kubernetes credentials before you deploy the image onto the Kubernetes cluster.

Before you create the deployments, make sure you check the deployment.yaml file. Kurt thinks they need some values set (he thinks he left some placeholder values).

Create the deployments from the deployment.yaml and service.yaml files.

From the Navigation Menu, select Kubernetes Engine > Services & Ingress. Click on the load balancer IP Address of the valkyrie-dev service to verify your services are up and running.
