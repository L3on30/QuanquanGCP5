Your challenge
You need to configure this simple environment securely. Your first challenge is to set up appropriate firewall rules and virtual machine tags. You also need to ensure that SSH is only available to the bastion via IAP.

For the firewall rules, make sure:

The bastion host does not have a public IP address.
You can only SSH to the bastion and only via IAP.
You can only SSH to juice-shop via the bastion.
Only HTTP is open to the world for juice-shop.


#Task 1: Check the firewall rules. Remove the overly permissive rules.
#Task 2: Navigate to Compute Engine in the Cloud Console and identify the bastion host. The instance should be stopped. Start the instance.
#Task 3: The bastion host is the one machine authorized to receive external SSH traffic. Create a firewall rule that allows SSH (tcp/22) from the IAP service. The firewall rule must be enabled for the bastion host instance using a network tag of SSH IAP network tag.
#Task 4: The juice-shop server serves HTTP traffic. Create a firewall rule that allows traffic on HTTP (tcp/80) to any address. The firewall rule must be enabled for the juice-shop instance using a network tag of HTTP network tag.
#Task 5: You need to connect to juice-shop from the bastion using SSH. Create a firewall rule that allows traffic on SSH (tcp/22) from acme-mgmt-subnet network address. The firewall rule must be enabled for the juice-shop instance using a network tag of SSH internal network tag.


###Paste these commands into your cloud console to finish Task1->5:

export IAP_NETWORK_TAG=accept-ssh-iap-ingress-ql-532                    //input your IAP_NETWORK_TAG here

export INTERNAL_NETWORK_TAG=accept-ssh-internal-ingress-ql-217          // input your INTERNAL_NETWORK_TAG here

export HTTP_NETWORK_TAG=accept-http-ingress-ql-309                      //input your HTTP_NETWORK_TAG here

export ZONE=us-east1-b                                                  //Go into VM instances and see your zone of bastion VM instances
